          <p>The vegan diet restricts all animal products for ethical, environmental, or health reasons.Veganism is also associated with resistance to animal exploitation and cruelty.How it works: Veganism is the strictest form of vegetarianism.
             In addition to eliminating meat, it eliminates dairy, eggs, and animal-derived products, such as gelatin, honey, albumin, whey, casein, and some forms of vitamin D3.
             Weight loss: A vegan diet seems to be very effective at helping people lose weight — often without counting calories — because its very low fat and high fiber content may make you feel fuller for longer.</p>

        </div>
  
        <div class="card__content">
          <p>Low-carb diets have been popular for decades — especially for weight loss There are several types of low-carb diets, but all involve limiting carb intake to 20–150 grams per day. The primary aim of the diet is to force your body to use more fats for fuel instead of using carbs as a main source of energy.
            How it works: Low-carb diets emphasize unlimited amounts of protein and fat while severely limiting your carb intake When carb intake is very low, fatty acids are moved into your blood and transported to your liver, where some of them are turned into ketones.Your body can then use fatty acids and ketones in the absence of carbs as its primary energy source.
